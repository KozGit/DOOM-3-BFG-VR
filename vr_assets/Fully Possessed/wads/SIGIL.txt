Primary purpose         : Single play, Co-op play, Deathmatch
Advanced engine needed  : Limit-removing; playing E5 ingame requires
                          either ZDoom or Eternity, though E5 is available
                          as a separate add-on (SIGIL_COMPAT.wad) for vanilla.
                          SIGIL.wad contains some maps, which may not be 100%
                          vanilla compatible.

Description             : Baphomet was only doing Satan's bidding by placing
                          a powerful sigil in the teleporter out of E4M8 to
                          bring you back to Hell. Somehow they didn't
                          understand that you're the reason they failed in the
                          first place.

                          It's time to trash the place with your arsenal, get out
                          of Hell, and back to Earth to face the more advanced 
                          demons that were sent ahead.

                          Lock and load. Rip and tear.

While in deathmatch maps, two players can agree to open the single-player area by flipping
one switch each at the same time to open a teleporter. Going through the teleporter will
take each player into the single-player area and permanently keep the teleporter open to
allow players to go between deathmatch and single-player maps.
