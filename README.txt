_______________________________

2) GENERAL NOTES
______________________

This release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

Only the Doom 3 BFG Edition is supported. Classic Doom 3 is not supported yet.

You should patch the game to the latest version. If using Steam, this will happen automatically.

Note that Doom 3 BFG Edition is available from the Steam store at
http://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/


Saved games:
------------
The saved game folder is:
%UserProfile%\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM 3 BFG\Fully Possessed

Your settings are also saved there as vr_oculus.cfg and vr_openvr.cfg
You can delte the those setting files to return to default settings.

It will also try to load games (with partial success) from:
%UserProfile%\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM 3 BFG\base
%UserProfile%\Saved Games\id Software\RBDOOM 3 BFG\base

Games loaded from other versions, other mods, or different texture packs
will have some glitches until you complete the level (which may not always be
possible without cheats). You should use the "restartMap" console command after
loading if you are near the start or you get stuck due to a glitch. It will
restart the map with your current inventory but without any glitches. You can
also use the "endLevel" console command to win the level and continue to the
next level (without any glitches) if you get stuck near the end. But that is
sort of cheating.


Steam:
------
The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality for integrating with 
Steam.  This includes roaming profiles, achievements, leaderboards, matchmaking, the overlay, or
any other Steam features.


Bink:
-----
The Doom3BFGVR Edition GPL Source Code release includes functionality for rendering Bink Videos through FFmpeg.


Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows:
--------------------------------------

The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as "Carmack's Reverse".


Mods:
-----

The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release allows mod editing. In order for it to accept any change in your
mod directory, you should first specify your mod directory adding the following command to the launcher:

The fs_game mod directory is used exclusively by DOOM3-BFG VR : Fully Possessed and should not be used by other
mods. Additional mods can my use the fs_game_base directory

"+set fs_game_base modDirectoryName"

so it would end up looking like: Doom3BFGVR +set fs_game_base mymod

This will result in the game searching the Fully Possessed directory, followed by the modDirectoryName directory,
and finally the BASE directory when loading assets.

Binary mods from Classic Doom 3 (non-BFG) mods are not supported.  
It is possible however to utilize some of the assets from Classic Doom mods,
however this is beyond the scope of this document.


___________________________________________________

3) INSTALLATION, GETTING THE GAMEDATA, RUNNING THE GAME
__________________________________________

1. Make sure you have Doom 3 BFG Edition installed in Steam.
   Doom 3 BFG Edition is also available from Good Old Games, but I haven't tested that version.

2. Set the Doom 3 BFG language in Steam to your desired language. 

3. In the unlikely event that you don't have the Visual C++ 2013 redistributable installed, get it here:
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40784

4. Old version 0.015 of this mod installed assets directly into the BASE directory of the Doom 3 BFG
   installation.  All assets are now installed into a separate mod folder named 'Fully Possessed'
   located in the Doom 3 BFG directory. An installer is now provided that will automatically remove
   files from old versions of this mod if present, and install the updated mod.  The installer doesn't
   add any files to the base folder, but it will remove files installed by mods that have the same 
   names as files used by this mod ( mostly weapons and player models ). This will NOT affect the base
   game, but could possibly break other mods installed.

   ( Note that at the time of this writing, the stock RBDOOM-3-BFGVR mod by Leyland does not install
   any assets, and this installation/removal process should not affect it. HOWEVER, if the hi-def 
   expansion has been installed in addition to the RBDOOM-3_BFGVR Mod, the hi-def expansion will 
   need to be reinstalled. )

   * If any other mods have been installed, or if you are unsure what deleting files may mean, it
   is STRONGLY recommended to make a backup copy of your Doom3 BFG installation before running the
   installer. *

5. Installing the mod:

   Start the Doom3BFGVR_Fully_Possessed_Alpha022.exe installer.

   If Doom 3 BFG was not originally installed on your main Steam hard-drive, change the install path
   to reflect the Doom 3 BFG installation directory. If you have enough disk space, it is recommended
   to select to install both Base and Player AAS files. The AAS files may be omitted, but will 
   negatively impact the ability to use teleportation.  It is only recommended to skip the AAS file
   installation if you do not plan on using teleportation.

   When installation is complete, a shortcut will be created on your desktop and in your program list.

6. If you want to use speech recognition to activate voice commands ( recommended ), it should be
   enabled in Windows and trained for optimal performance.  Speech recognition settings are available
   in the Control Panel under 'Speech recognition.' At a minimum run 'Set up microphone', and for 
   optimal performance 'Train your computer to better understand you' 

7. If you have an Oculus Rift: In the Oculus Home window, turn on: (cog), Settings, General, Unknown
   Sources

8. Run the shortcut on your desktop, or run the Doom3BFGVR.exe file in your Doom 3 BFG folder to 
   launch the game. (SteamVR will be automatically activated if needed)

   To play the game, you need the game data from a legal copy of the game, which 
   requires Steam for Windows. Currently, Doom 3 BFG: Fully Possessed is only officially compatible
   with Windows, but see the Linux section.

9. Enjoy

10. If you run into bugs, please report them. ( see section 9 )

DOOM3-BFG VR : Fully Possessed offers many new features:

Native support for the HTC Vive via OpenVR when detected.
Native support for the Oculus Rift and Touch via the Oculus SDK when detected.



- Motion Controls: Full motion controls are supported.
		
	Independent	weapon and flashlight control via motion controllers.
	
	All in game GUIs ( including the in game PDA ) can be interacted with as touch screens.
	
	Game and VR settings can be adjusted in game via a touch screen interface.
	
	A weapon slot system has been implemented.  The player may use motion controls to stash or 
	retrieve a weapon or the PDA from virtual holsters located on the player body.  The player
	may also use motion controls to grab or place the flashlight on the head or the body, and 
	then pick it back up in the hand later.  
	
	Full room-scale support.  ( See locomotion ) 
	

	
- Locomotion:  Multiple locomotion options are supported.

	Teleportation support:
	  
	  A parabolic aiming beam identifies areas the player can teleport to, as identified by
	  the game AAS system. Teleporting to a location will cause the player to activate all in
	  game 'triggers' along the path the player would walk to reach the destination.  This 
	  includes activating cutscenes, alerting or activating monsters, triggering any in game
	  scripted events, and taking any environmental damage that the player would incur along
	  this route. Players may not teleport through closed doors, or to areas the AAS system
	  has marked as unreachable by the player.
	  
	  LIMITATIONS:  Doom 3 was not initially designed with the idea of teleportation in mind.
	  Doom 3 uses an Area Awareness System (AAS) to determine if a location is reachable by a
	  character in the game, and then generate a path to that point. AAS files have been 
	  generated for the player for most of the levels in the game, but there are limitations.
	  Issues can happen for example if trying to teleport onto a desk - you will teleport to 
	  the desk but then be bounced to the floor, just as if you had tried to jump on the desk.
	  The AAS system is also currently unable to identify areas that are only reachable by 
	  ladder, so it is not currently possible to teleport to an area if the only way to reach 
	  it is via ladder. Additionally, there are a few small	areas in the game the AAS system 
	  is not aware of, and therefore cannot be teleported to. In these instances, the player
	  will need to use normal locomotion to reach these areas and continue the game.

	Full room-scale support.
	  
	  Your character can walk around and crouch using your real life motion. Walking in real
	  life allows you to walk around in the game, including walking up and down stairs or off
	  ledges.  You can push small shipping containers and other items with real life motion.
	  Solid objects cannot be walked through, but they can be leaned over to some degree. 
	  Jumping via real life motion is not supported.

	Gamepad and Motion Controller locomotion:
	
	  Gamepad or Motion Controller Pads, Sticks, or Buttons can be used for artificial 
	  locomotion.  Options are included for controller relative movement ( Onward style ),
	  and normal gamepad style movement controls.  There are a variety of options available
	  to the player, including smooth turning, comfort (snap) turning, and multiple comfort
	  options to reduce the effects of VR sickness when using artificial movement.  All of the
	  controls can be rebound or disabled ( for example, turning or strafe can be removed 
	  completely from the controllers ), and the various comfort options enabled or disabled.
	  These changes can be easily made in game via touch screen access to VR specific game 
	  menus using the PDA.

	Comfort Options:
	
	  There are various locomotion options available to assist in preventing motion sickness,
	  including comfort ( snap ) turning, third person movement, movement based FOV reduction,
	  slow motion movement, and using the Chaperone boundaries to provide a static reference.
	  
- Voice Commands:

	DOOM3-BFG VR : Fully Possessed supports voice commands via the Windows speech recognition
	engine.  System commands such as pause, resume, and menu are accessible by speaking.  
	Additionally, the player may 'Talk' to NPC's simply by speaking to them when they are in
	focus.  ( Talking does not imply the NPCs carry out an actual conversation - speaking to
	them prompts them to say their predetermined lines.)  All weapons can be selected by 
	saying their name, and can also be reloaded by voice command.  Phrases that activate each
	voice command are defined in a plaintext file that can be modified by the user to customize
	behavior.
	

	
- Character and Weapon Options:

	The player may choose to display the full character body while playing.  Basic IK is 
	implemented for the player head, arms, and crouch height, so movement in real life is
	replicated in the game to some degree. Note that the IK is extremely basic, and often
	results in incorrect poses.  
	
	If they player does not wish to see their body while playing ( for example if the incorrect
	arm IK is found to be to distracting, annoying, or just silly ), the player body may be 
	disabled. There are options to instead display only the active weapon with hands and a stat
	watch, or just the active weapon with no hands.	
	
	The stat watch is a display located on the player wrist that indicates the current ammo 
	status for the active weapon, as well as vertical Health and Armor bars to monitor player 
	status.  The Health bar is located on the left side of the statwatch, and the Armor bar is
	on the right.  The bars will shrink and change color as health and armor are depleted.  
	
	
	
- HUD and GUI options:

	The HUD is now projected into the world as a translucent object.  The HUD can be enabled
	fully, disabled, or can activate when the player looks down past a user defined angle.
	Individual elements of the HUD can be hidden if desired. The HUD position can be adjusted
	by the user, and locked to either the player view or the player body.
	
	In game GUIS such as the PDA, interactive computers, card readers, buttons, or keypads can
	be interacted with simply by touching them with your virtual finger as you would a normal
	touchscreen.  If desired, touchscreen mode can be deactivated, and gui interaction can be
	controlled either by aiming your weapon or via gaze aiming.
	
	
	
- Flicksync:

	Flicksync is an experimental mode based on the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. 
	In the book, players in a virtual environment participate in and act out the lines of their
	favorite movies, and their virtual performances scored.
	
	In this just for fun mode, the player selects a character to portray in the game. The aim
	is to act out the game's cutscenes by becoming that character. You must say all of that 
	character's lines exactly at the appropriate times. Points are earned by saying your lines
	correctly, clearly, and at the right time. ( See the Flicksync section under Controls for
	full instructions .) The Flicksync mode is still a work in progress, so bugs are to be 
	expected.


___________________________________________________

5) CHANGES
__________________________________________

- VR support (Doom 3 only, 1 and 2 use a virtual screen in VR)

- Motion Controls

- Voice Commands

- Flicksync Mode

- Better looking cola cans and video discs

- Mostly uncensored Doom 1 and 2 (still no blue SS soldiers in secret level)

- Fixed Doom 2 extra secret level MAP33: Betray (accessed by pushing a wall in level 2).

- Win64 support

- OpenAL Soft sound backend primarily developed for Linux but works on Windows as well

- Bink video support through FFmpeg

- Soft shadows using PCF hardware shadow mapping

	The implementation uses sampler2DArrayShadow and PCF which usually
	requires Direct3D 10.1 however it is in the OpenGL 3.2 core so it should
	be widely supported.
	All 3 light types are supported which means parallel lights (sun) use
	scene independent cascaded shadow mapping.
	The implementation is very fast with single taps (400 fps average per
	scene on a GTX 660 ti OC) however I defaulted it to 16 taps so the shadows look
	really good which should give you stable 100 fps on todays hardware (2014).

- Changed light interaction shaders to use Half-Lambert lighting like in Half-Life 2 to 
	make the game less dark. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half_Lambert



___________________________________________________
	
6) CONTROLS
__________________________________________


* IMPORTANT * ALL CONTROLS CAN BE EASILY CUSTOMIZED/REMAPPED BY THE USER *

	Un-Binding or Binding controls:
	
	  Any axis or button can be re-mapped to any movement or control function.
	  Rebinding controls is accomplished through the 'Settings->Controls->Key Bindings' menu.
	  This menu is available from the Main Menu when the game is first launched, or
	  by pressing the System Menu button in game, and selecting the 'Settings->Controls->
	  Key	Bindings' menu on the PDA.
	  
	  Be careful not to speak when binding a control, or you will rebind what talking does.
	  You can't rebind specific voice commands. Edit the dict file instead.
	  The thumb rests on the Touch controllers can be bound, so be careful not to bump them.
	  
	  You can use the right joystick and trigger to highlight and select an action.
	  If you are in game and using the PDA to adjust settings, you may use motion controls 
	  and your virtual finger to access the menu as a touch screen.  Touch an entry once to 
	  highlight, and touch again to select.
	  
	  Use the joystick or touch controls to highlight a command and see its current bindings.
	  If available, button graphics will identify a bound control, otherwise a text descriptor 
	  is used. If the list of bindings is longer than the available space in the menu, the full
	  binding list for the selected action is listed (without button graphics) at the bottom 
	  of the screen.
	  
	  Select the highlighted action with the trigger or by tapping. Once selected, you can unbind
	  a currently bound control or add a new binding. To unbind a control, simply press the axis
	  or button you would like to unbind and it will be removed from the list. To bind a control,
	  simply press the desired button or axis and it will be added to the binding list.  If the 
	  desired button/axis	is currently bound to another action, you will be asked if you want to 
	  continue and reassign it to this command ( removing the existing binding ), or to cancel.
	  
	  Changing comfort ( snap ) turning:
	    
	    By default, the game is configured to use comfort or snap turning.
	    This can be easily changed via the Settings->VR Options->Comfort Options
	    menu, under the Turning option.  Cycle through the various options to select the turning
	    mode you prefer.  ( Analog mode provides the typical smooth turning function - however
	    this is one of the most common cause of VR sickness.)
	    
	    Alternative, you may manually rebind Turn Left, Turn Right, Comfort Turn Left, and 
	    Comfort Turn Right in the Settings->Controls->Key Bindings menu.
	      
	  
	  
Default controls for the Oculus Touch, HTC Vive, and Gamepad :

*	Read each section carefully. The controls behave differently depending
	on if you are playing the game or using a menu or the PDA. *
	  
	  
	Walking and crouching in real life are reflected in the game. You can
	walk up and down steps, over ledges, or push small objects by walking in
	real life.  Crouching can also be controlled via button, see below.
	
	By default, the flashlight ( or PDA when active ) are held in the left hand,
	and the weapon is held in the right hand.  This can be changed by picking up the 
	weapon or PDA from it's slot with your other hand, or through the VR Options->
	Character Options: Weapon Hand menu entry.
	
	Grenades are thrown via motion controls - press
	the trigger to start the throw, swing your arm and release the trigger to throw.
	
	
  _________________________________________	  
  Default Control Bindings: Oculus Touch

	*IN MENUS OR PDA:
	
	  Use either stick to highlight menu entries.
	  Press either trigger to select.
	  Press Y or Grip to go back/exit.
	  
	  If you are using the PDA, or the System Menus on the PDA in game,
	  you can use your virtual finger to select menu items just like using
	  a touch screen.
	
	*GAMEPLAY CONTROLS.

	  LEFT Controller:
	  
	    By default, the LEFT controller/hand will aim the flashlight, once equipped.
	    
	    Left Stick: 	The left stick controls player movement.
	    
	    	    The default configuration is motion relative to the direction the 
		    controller is pointing ( Onward style ).  
	            
	            Artificial motion will induce VR sickness for most people, so 
		    teleportation instead of stick control should be considered as a
		    primary form of movement in these instances.
	            
	            For those who find teleportation immersion breaking or uncomfortable,
	            there are a variety of ( optional ) comfort modes available in the VR 
		    menus. These modes include FOV reduction, Slo-Motion, Black Screen and 
		    Chaperone effects to reduce the discomfort caused by mismatched vection.
		    See the VR MENUS section for more details.
	           
	    Left Grip:  	Crouch.
	              
	    
	    Left Stick 
	    Press: 	    Press the left stick down to toggle the flashlight on and off.
	    
	    
	    Left Trigger:	Hold to run.
	    
	    Left Y:		Recenter view/reset height.
	           
		   If you stand up or sit down while playing, press this to adjust the
	            game to your new position.
	            
	            If the player body is visible, use this to reset the body to face the
	            current view direction.
	            
	    
	    Left X:		Activate the PDA if it's in you inventory.
	          
		    Left X also will skip the active cutscene.
	            In a Flicksync, this gives up on the current line.
	                
	        
	    Left ≡ (menu)	Brings up the in game Pause/System menu on the PDA.
	          
		  ( The PDA does not need to be in you inventory to use this function)
	            
	          
	  
	  RIGHT CONTROLLER:

	    By default the RIGHT controller controls the right hand and the weapon 
	    
	    Right Stick
	    Up/Down:		Next / Previous Weapon
	    
	    Right Stick
	    Left/Right:		Snap turn 45 degrees left or right.
	    
	    Right Grip:		Reload
	          
	    Right Stick
	    Press:		Jump
	    
	    Right Trigger:	Attack / Fire
	           
		   Use Cue Card Power-Up in Flicksync
	    
	    Right A:		Reload
	    
	    Right B:		Teleport

	  you can use your virtual finger to select menu items just like using
	  a touch screen.
	
	*GAMEPLAY CONTROLS.

	  LEFT Controller:
	  
	    By default, the LEFT controller/hand will aim the flashlight, once equipped.
	    
	    Left Pad:		The left stick controls player movement.  
	    	
		    The default configuration is motion relative to the direction the
		    controller is pointing ( Onward style ).  
	            
	            Artificial motion will induce VR sickness for most people, so 
		    teleportation instead of stick control should be considered as a
		    primary form of movement in these instances.
	            
	            For those who find teleportation immersion breaking or uncomfortable,
	            there are a variety of ( optional ) comfort modes available in the VR
		    menus. These modes include FOV reduction, Slo-Motion, Black Screen and
		    Chaperone effects to reduce the discomfort caused by mismatched vection.
		    See the VR MENUS section for more details.
	           
	    Left Grip:  	Crouch.
	              
	    
	    Left Pad 
	    Press: 	    Press the left pad down to toggle the flashlight on and off.
	    
	    
	    Left Trigger:	Jump
	                      
	        
	    Left ≡ (menu)	Activate the PDA if it's in you inventory.
	           
		    Will skip the active cutscene.
	            In a Flicksync, this gives up on the current line.
	            
	          
	  
	  RIGHT CONTROLLER:

	    By default the RIGHT controller controls the right hand and the weapon

  Default Control Bindings: Gamepad


	You can play the game in VR using an XBox 360/One gamepad if you don't have motion 
	controllers. The game will automatically switch to gamepad mode when you start 
	using the gamepad. You can use the gamepad for room-scale if you want.

	    Left Stick: 	Movement.
	    
	    	  This can cause motion sickness, So it's recommended to 
	          teleport by holding B, looking where you want to go, and letting go.

  Default Control Bindings: Keyboard / Mouse


	You can play the game in VR using keyboard and mouse if you don't have motion
	controllers.  The game will NOT automatically switch to gamepad mode when you start
	using the keyboard, so you might need to turn on gamepad mode manually in the VR options
	if your arms are weird.	You can't use the mouse for room-scale yet because we haven't
	implemented head aiming.

	    WASD:		Movement. 
	   
	   	  This can cause motion sickness, So it's recommended to 
	          teleport by holding RMB, looking where you want to go, and letting go.

	_________________________________________	  
	Using the PDA: 
	  
	  You can move the PDA around in your hand, while using your right finger to touch the
	  screen to select entries or scroll bars. You can also use the sticks/pads and buttons
	  on each hand to select options.

	  Use Y or grip to put your PDA away again.

	  If the tracking glitches, your PDA can end up far away. If this occurs,  repeatedly
	  press Y or Grip to close the PDA. ( This is a known issue that will be addressed )
	  
	  You can also manually grab the PDA from your left hip using motion controls.
	  When you move the left controller over the correct spot, the right controller 
	  vibrates. Use the grip button to pick up the PDA. Your flashlight will be temporarily
	  holstered on your hip while using the PDA.

	  When you are finished with the PDA, you can place it back the same way, and grab your
	  flashlight. ( Grabbing the PDA before you collect it from Reception brings up the 
	  pause menu instead of the PDA. )
	  
	_________________________________________	  
	Using the System/Pause menu:
	
	  Activating the System/Pause menu ( Press ≡ (menu) on the left Touch or Right Vive )
	  will pause the game and display the system menus on the PDA as above. You can 
	  load/save/exit the game, Change the control bindings via System->Controls->Key Bindings,
	  or adjust the various VR options via VR Options. See the section on VR options for more
	  details.

	  Touch the 'Back' options, or press Y or the Grips to go back/exit.
	  
	  
	_________________________________________	  
	Teleporting:
	
	  You can teleport anywhere you could normally reach by walking, ducking, or jumping
	  onto things.  When you teleport, your character will trigger any in game events and
	  take any environmental damage that the player would incur by walking the route to the
	  destination.
	  
	  You can't teleport across gaps you have to jump across, or onto the tightrope in the
	  Mars City Underground level. There is a path length/complexity limit on how far you
	  can teleport in one hop, but it's fairly far. There are some bugs in the Player AAS
	  files, and some levels are missing, so there are instances where you can't teleport
	  places you should be able to. In these instances, walk in real life or move forward
	  with the stick/pad a little until you can teleport again. If you didn't install the
	  Player AAS files at install, you will only be able to teleport places a Zombie can go.
	  
	  To teleport, push in the right touchpad, or hold down B on Touch, then move your hand
	  to aim the parabola where you want to go. Release the stick or touchpad to teleport 
	  there. Pressing the trigger while the aiming beam is active will cancel the teleport.
	  If the teleport target is red, you will need to duck/crouch before teleporting to the 
	  destination.	If there's no circle, that means you can't teleport there from your current
	  location.
	  
	  There are two teleportation modes. "Blink" teleports you instantly. "QuakeCon" slows 
	  time and warps you there.
	  
	_________________________________________	  
	Using Slots:
	
	  Slots are locations defined on the player body you can stash or retrieve weapons, the PDA,
	  or the flashlight by using motion controls to grab/stash them.  When a motion controller
	  is inside of a slot area, the right controller will vibrate.  When the controller 
	  vibrates, press the grip button on the controller in the slot to grab/place/swap the item.
	      
	  You can manually place the flashlight on your left shoulder or your head using the slots,
	  and then later retrieve it from those places the same way.

	  You can swap your hands by grabbing the holster on your right hip with your left hand. 
	  This will transfer the flashlight to your right side and pick up any holstered weapon in
	  your left. Swapping hands will swap most of the controls, but does not swap the analog
	  sticks/touchpads.


	  You can manually grab the holster on your right hip to holster your weapon.
	  If there's already a weapon holstered there, the weapons will swap.

	  You can grab behind your weapon hand's shoulder to switch to the next weapon.
	  You can grab behind your weapon hand's lower back for previous weapon.

	  You can also grab the PDA on your left hip with your right hand, if you prefer.
	  You can then put it back on the same side like normal, or holster PDA on the right
	  to switch hands.
	  
	_________________________________________	
	Interacting with Guis:
	
	  To use a touchscreen/gui, walk up to the screen and look at it.  When you have 
	  focused on the gui, your weapon will lower and your hand will point a finger and 
	  raise to the gui. You can now reach out and use the gui like a normal touchscreen.
	  
	  To exit the gui, walk backwards or teleport.


	
	_________________________________________	
	Motion Control Errata:
	
	Currently, you cannot use motion controls to pick up items in the environment, or to 
	punch/melee attack. ( These features are being worked on)

	If you are displaying the player body, and the arms look strange due to a bad IK pose,
	use the controller to move the character forward. This will make your body face the
	correct direction. If your body isn't attached to your neck properly, try jumping.  
	If things just seem out of alignment, or to switch from seated to standing mode,
	Recenter view/reset height with whichever button is defined (you must say "reset view"
	on Vive).


	

Voice Controls:

	You can use the built in microphone in the Rift or the Vive to activate voice commands
	using Windows built in Speech Recognition.
	
	If you want to use speech recognition to activate voice commands ( recommended ), it 
	should be enabled in Windows and trained for optimal performance.  Speech recognition
	settings are available in the Control Panel under 'Speech recognition.' At a minimum
	run 'Set up microphone', and for optimal performance 'Train your computer to better
	understand you' 
	
	The phrases recognized by the voice commands are defined in the 
	"Fully Possessed/dict/voice.dict" file.  
	This file may be edited to change the phrases associated with each action.
	
	Apart from the default English language, other languages (Spanish as of now) are available in Fully Possessed/dict/
	just rename the corresponding voiceXXX.dict to voice.dict in order to use that language.
	
	Available Voice Commands:
	
	Talk:
	
	    Speak to other people by walking up to them and speaking.
	    You can say whatever you want. After you finish talking, they will respond.
	    They will briefly look at you when you first start speaking.
	    Speaking can wake up nearby monsters, so be careful!
	    
	  Say: Anything
	  
	
	Recenter view:
	
	    This resets the view height to you current view position,
	    and makes the player and the view face your current view direction.
	    Useful for switching between sitting and standing mode of if the 
	    player body becomes disoriented.
	    
	  Say:
	     	Reset View
	      	Recenter View
	      	Reset HMD Orientation
	      	Reset HMD View

7) FLICKSYNC
__________________________________________


Flicksync is an experimental mode based on the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. 
In the book, players in a virtual environment participate in and act out the lines of
their favorite movies, and their virtual performances scored. The Flicksync mode is
still a work in progress, so bugs are to be expected.

How Flicksync is played:
 
	In this just for fun mode, the aim is to act out the game's cutscenes by becoming
	a character in the game. You must say all of that character's lines exactly at the
	appropriate times. Points are earned by saying your lines correctly, clearly, and
	at the right time.  

	If you don't say the line in time, the other character will repeat the cue (with
	subtitles), "Final Dialog Warning" will appear, and the game will pause indefinitely
	waiting for you to say it.

	If you can't remember the line, pull the trigger to use a Cue Card Power-Up (if you
	have one).  The Cue Card will show you what you need to say (phonetically) in white
	near the top.

	If you don't have a Cue Card Power-Up, or the speech recognition can't recognize the
	way you say it,	you can press the PDA or menu button to give up that line and lose 
	10 points. After you give up twice in a row, it will say "Final Warning". A third failure
	is GAME OVER.

	Pressing the PDA or menu button while it's not waiting for a line, will skip the 
	cutscene like normal.

	When you say the line correctly, you get 100 points. If you say the line clearly and at
	roughly the right time, you get another 50 bonus points. If you get 7 lines right in a
	row, you get another Cue Card Power-Up, up to a maximum of 5.

	There are no action bonuses yet, and you automatically follow the character's path.

	If the cutscene seems to finish, but it won't let you move, it's still waiting for you
	to say the last line of the cutscene ( or to skip it ).

	When you have finished all the cutscenes you chose, you win, and it will say "Flicksync
	Complete". If you were playing in Cutscenes Only mode, then all the NPCs and monsters
	will disappear and you will go back to being yourself instead of your character. You 
	can then walk around the empty level and use the level's exit to return to the main 
	menu, or use the pause menu to exit.


Starting a Flicksync game:


	To start a Flicksync game, choose Campaign from the main menu, then select Flicksync.

	Choose which character you will be.

	Choose how many Cue Cards you start with.

	Choose whether to play just the Flicksync cutscene parts, or play the normal Doom 3 game
	with Flicksync mode for the cutscenes, or a non-Flicksync game with no cutscenes.
	The "no cutscenes" mode carries over into regular games, so don't leave it set to no 
	cutscenes if you want cutscenes.
	
	Choose which scenes you want to play.
	  
	  You can play:
	  	  
		  All the cutscenes
	          Just the cutscenes for your character's expansion
	          All the scenes starting from your character's first scene,
	          All the scenes related to your character's story arc
	          Just the scenes with your character in them.
	  
	  There's currently a bug where you must watch the first cutscene of a map if that
	  cutscene starts automatically on map startup, and you have a scene in a later
	  cutscene of that map.
	          
	Then choose the highest level you have reached in the game if you want to avoid spoilers.

	Choose Play.

	You will start from a different point depending on which character or scenes you choose.

	You can also watch the cutscenes from the POV of the player character(s) by choosing Player,
	or you can just watch all the cutscenes by setting Character to None and Game Mode to
	Cutscenes Only.

Flicksync settings carry over if you start a map from the DEV menu, so you may 
want to change them back to normal first.

Starting a new game from the Campaign / New game menu will clear the flicksync settings,
except for the "no cutscenes" option.
You will see SCORE: 0 on the menus if you are in Flicksync mode.

8) VR Options
__________________________________________


VR Related game changes can be made from the Settings->VR Options menu.

	Menu: Character Options:
	
	  Body Mode:  
	  
	    Full Body + Arms:
	      
	        The full player body will be displayed in game, with 
	        ( very ) basic IK for the arms.  While playing,
	        if the arms seem misaligned with the body, move in any direction
	        to align the body direction with the movement direction.  Alternatively,
	        you can press or say the button/command to reset the view. ( Left Y on Touch,
	        or say Reset View)
	        
	    Hands + Weaps:
	    
	        If you do not wish to see the player body ( perhaps the basic arm IK
	        is too basic :) ), select this option to display your hands and weapons only.
	        
	    Weapons Only:
	    
	        Selection this option will display only the weapons in game, no player body
	        or hands.  ( Hands will be displayed if there is currently no weapon selected,
		if the fists are selected, or if interacting with a GUI.)
	        
	    Note that Body Mode also affects Flicksync. But in Flicksync you will be fully 
	    invisible if you chose Hands + Weaps or Weapons Only.
	  
	  
	  Flashlight Mount:
	  
	        Select where the flashlight will be mounted during the game.
	        
	        Options: 
		
		      Hand - 	Hold the flashlight in the non weapon hand.
	              		Flashlight can be aimed with motion controls.
	              
	              Body - 	The flashlight will be mounted to the body,
	                  	and shine in the direction the body is facing.
	                
	              Head - 	The flashlight will be mounted to the head
	                  	and shine where you are looking.
	                  
	              Weapon-	The flashlight will be mounted to the muzzle of
	                  	your weapon.  In the event the weapon has no muzzle
	                  	( grenade, chainsaw, soul cube, etc ) the flashlight
	                  	will temporarily move to your head.
	                  
	        You can change this in-game by manually grabbing your flashlight and 
		placing it where you want it (except for on the weapon), if Holster 
		Slots are enabled.
	  
	  Weapon Hand
	      
	        Select the handedness of the game.
	        
	        Options:
		
		      Right - 	The weapon will default to the right hand,
	                  	flashlight / PDA will be in the left.
	                  
	              Left - 	The weapon will default to the left hand,

	        Custom Eye Height:	The player's view height (specified above) will be the
					same height as your real eyes. This might make you feel
					like you're floating above the floor.

	        Marine eye height:	Your eyes will be at the Doom marine's eye height.
	                          	This is 5 inches higher than the view height in the 
					original Doom 3.
	
	        Normal view height:	Your eyes will be at the original height specified by
					the game.

	        Crouch to your height:	The virtual floor will always be at the same height as
					the real floor.	The Doom marine crouches if you're shorter
					than he is.
	
	        Scale to your height:	The virtual floor will always be at the same height as the
					real floor.  The whole world is scaled to make the Doom 
					marine your height.
	
	  Custom Eye Height
	  
	        Change the height of the player view, measured in real world units.
	        Use this option if you are taller or shorter than the default view.
	        This setting is now saved between maps and sessions.
	        It has no effect in "Scale to your height" mode.
	
	  World Scale Adjust:	
	  
	  	Multiply the size of the world by this. ( This works now. )   
	  

	Menu: Comfort Options

	  This menu allows the player select options intended to combat motion sickness,

		      Right Hand - 	The teleport aiming beam will originate from the 
	               		        right hand, or device in the right hand.
	                      
	              Left Hand - 	The teleport aiming beam will originate from the 
	                      		left hand, or device in the left hand.
	                      
	              Head - 	    	Use you view to aim the teleport beam.
	              
	              Disabled -	Disable teleport and teleport aiming.
	              
	              Gun Sight - 	Do not use the parabolic teleport aiming beam,
		      			instead use the weapon sight.  The laser reticle
					will change to indicate if you are able to teleport
					to a location. You must set the weapon sight to dot
					mode to use this option. This option may also hurt
					frame rate, as the teleport destination is always
					being scanned.
	                      
	        If you swap hands using the weapons slots, the teleport aiming will swap as well.
	        
	        
	        
	  Teleport Mode:
	  
	      Choose whether to teleport instantly, or slow time and warp along the path.
	        
	      Options:
	            
		      Blink - 		Aiming is like normal, teleporting is instant and 
		      			covered by a blink.
	                      
	              QuakeCon - 	Time is slowed while aiming. Teleport by moving at 
		      			warp speed to the destination. This style was used
					in a Doom (2016) VR demo at QuakeCon.

	  Turning:
	      
	        Change the turning mode. Changing the turning menu option will remap your control 
	        bindings for whatever controls you assigned to turning to support the selected mode.
	        If you want to use a combination of Analog and Comfort turning, you can adjust the
	        control bindings yourself in Settings->Controls->Key Bindings.
	        
	        This setting only affects motion controllers. Set Key Bindings for keyboard or 
		gamepad.
	        
	        Options:
		
		      Snap ( 10 - 180 ) Comfort turning will be used. Each turn will move the
		      			view/reset the selected number of degrees.
	                      	
	              Real Life -	No artificial turning will be used, the player will 
		      			need to turn in real life to turn in the game. 
	                      	
	              Analog - 		The analog stick can be used to turn the player smoothly.
	                      		This option is causes the most motion sickness. It is not
					recommended for the regular user, and should only be
					used by people who never experience VR sickness.
	                      	
	                      	
	              
	  Walk Speed Adjust:
	  
	        Adjust the movement speed of the player.
	        
	        This value can be changed to increase or decrease the maximum walk speed
	        of the player from the normal value of 140. Negative values slow movement,
	        positive values will increase it. This value persists throughout the game.
	        There's an alternative to "Walk Speed Adjust" in the next option, which slows
	        time instead. If you opt to use that, you can set Walk Speed Adjust here to 0.
	        
	  
	  Motion Sickness Aid:

	        If you experience any form of VR sickness, this is one of the most important
		options to experiment with. It applies an effect whenever you're moving 
		artificially, whether using the joystick, jumping, crouching, or because you
		were pushed by something in the game, or you fell off a ledge, or you tried
		to walk in real life through a solid virtual object. Some effects can work in
		combination with other effects.
	                  
	        There are a variety of options to ( hopefully ) assist in preventing motion
		sickness during player movement. The best way to avoid motion sickness is to
		play standing up, walking, turning, and crouching in real life, while using 
		teleportation and third person mode for all artificial movement. You can play
		this way even if using a gamepad.
	  
	        The most common cause of motion sickness is using the analog stick to turn the
		view, so this should be avoided whenever possible if you are susceptible to VR
		sickness. There are some places where you have to use artificial movement though,
		such as climbing ladders, jumping across gaps, and some glitchy areas not 
		accessible via teleport, so hopefully these menu options can help.
	        
	        Options:	
		     Third Person -	When artificial motion is used, the player view will 
		     			remain stationary, and the player character will be 
					controlled in the third person via analog controls.
					When the character stops moving, the player view will
					fade to the new character location. This is a very 
					effective way to combat motion sickness.  There is
					currently one drawback: Moving backwards is not well
					implemented (yet).  If you move backwards, you will 
					not be able to see the character you are controlling
					unless you turn around, so it is recommended to	only
					move backwards in short hops.
	                      	
	              None -		If you are fortunate enough to never experience motion
		      			sickness, you can select this option to disable all
					motion sickness aids. Be warned, this is only for those
					who truly have 'VR legs'.
	                      	
	              Chaperone -	Turns on the Chaperone ( or Guardian ) grid whenever you
		      			are Moving artificially. Any grid that's solidly locked
					to the real world is supposed to help with motion 
					sickness. The other methods may be more effective or less
					intrusive. Chaperone can be combined with other effects
					( including "Black Screen" if you don't like the empty 
					void).

	              Reduce Fov -	Reduce FOV, or "Tunnel vision" will block out your 
		      			peripheral vision when moving, which for some people
					is where most motion sickness comes from. It can be
					combined with other effects such as Chaperone.
	                      	
	              
	              Black Screen -	The only 100% effect mode, it completely blacks out 
		      			your view while moving artificially, so there's no
					vection and no motion sickness. It will strobe a brief
					frame a couple of times per second. ( The strobe time
					can be adjusted with the console variable vr_strobeTime
	                      		which is in ms). Obviously blacking out the screen makes
					it harder to navigate and see what you're doing, but if
					you are not using artificial navigation much ( only when
					you cant teleport ) it can be useful.
	                      	
	              Black + Chaperone-
		      			
					Combine the Black Screen and Chaperone aids.
	              
	              FOV + Chaperone- 	Combine FOV Reduction and Chaperone aids.
	              
	              Slo Mo-		Slows time while you are moving, to make it feel like 
		      			you are moving slower, but without harming your ability
					to dodge and escape from monsters. The faster you move,
					the more time is slowed. The downside of this mode is 
					that all the sound and voices are slowed down. This 
					effect can be combined with Chaperone and/or Reduce FOV.

	              SloMo + Chaperone-
		      			
					Combine Slo-Mo with Chaperone.
	              
	              Slo Mo + FOV-	Combine Slo-Mo with FOV Reduction.
	              
	              Slo+FOV+Chaperone-
		      			
					Combine Slo-Mo, FOV Reduction, and Chaperone effects.

		  This setting has moved to the VR Options > Rendering Options menu.
		  
	  Knockback and Head Kick:
	  
	      Knockback and Headkick are Doom 3's effects that push your view. Knockback is when 
	      your entire player body is moved due to impact. Head Kick is when your view 'Kicks'
	      due to an impulse such as firing a weapon or being struck. They don't work well in 
	      VR, and can contribute to motion sickness, so they are disabled by default. They 
	      can be enabled if desired.
	      
	        Options:
		
		      Knockback Only-	The player body will be knocked back due to impacts.
	        
	              Headkick Only-	The player view can kick due to impulses.
	              
	              Enabled-		Both Knockback and Headkick will be enabled.
	              
	              Disabled-		either Knockback or Headkick are enabled.
	              
	  Step Smooth and Jump Bounce:
	  
	      Affect the player view when going up and down steps, or after landing from a
	      jump or fall.
	      
	        Options:
	        
	              Step Smooth Only-
		      
		      		Step Smooth makes climbing stairs smooth instead of jarring.
				Smooth motion increases motion sickness, but in this case can 
	                      	be jarring without it. Enabled by default, but can be turned 
	                      	off if you prefer. This option enables smooth steps and 
	                      	disables jump bouncing.
	                      	
	              Jump Bounce Only-
		      
		      		Jump Bounce is when your view bounces when landing after jumping.
	                      	It can be uncomfortable, so it's disabled by default, but this
				option enables the jump bounce but not smooth stepping.
	                      	
	              Enabled-
		      		
				Steps will be smooth and the view will bounce when landing.
	              
	              Disabled-	
		      		
				Steps will be instant, and the view will not bounce when landing.
	              
	  Shake Amplitude:
	  
	      Doom 3 has screen shaking effects in some areas of the game. You can adjust
	      the amplitude of these effects. Moving the slider all the way to the left
	      disables the effect completely, and moving the slider to the right will 
	      increase the effect until it reaches full power.
	      
	      This effect can be very uncomfortable, so it is disabled by default.

		    		The joysticks or pads will control the character
	                      	like a standard gamepad.  Pressing forward will move
	                      	the player forward in relation to the body.
	                      	
	            Off Hand = Forward-
		    
		    		Forward motion is relative to the direction the off hand
	                      	controller is pointing. ( 'Onward' style movement. )
	                      	
	            Look = Forward-

	            Full Motion Crouching-
		    
		    		The player can crouch in real life to crawl through
		   		ducts or narrow passages.
	                      	
	            Crouch Trigger-
		    
		    		If the player in real life crouches a distance greater than
	                      	the number of inches defined by 'Crouch Trigger', it will act
	                      	as if the crouch button has been pressed.
	                      	
	  Crouch Trigger Dist:
	  
	  			The number of inches they player must crouch in real life
				in order to trigger a full crouch when using 'Crouch Trigger'

	          PDA Pitch:		The pitch of the PDA screen if Fix In Space is selected.
	                      	
	            
	            

	  Heading Beam:
	  
	    The heading beam is an optional directional indicator that may aid the player
	    when controlling the character.
	    
	      Options:
	      
	          Disabled-		The heading beam will not be displayed.
	          
	          Solid-		A solid heading beam will be displayed.
	          
	          Arrows-		A heading beam with arrows will be displayed.
	          
	          Scrolling Arrows-	A heading beam will scrolling arrows will be displayed.
	          
	  Weapon Sight:
	  
	    Various weapon sights are available.
	    
	      Options:
	          Disabled-		No laser sight.
	      
	          Laser Beam-		A laser beam will emit from the weapon to aim with.
	          
	          Red Dot-		A red laser dot will be projected into the world
		  			to aim with.
	          
	          Circle Dot-		A reticle with a red circle with a dot in the center
		  			will be projected into the world to aim with.
	          
	          Crosshair-		A red crosshair will be projected into the world to
		  			aim with.
	          
	          Laser + Dot-		Both the dot and the laser beam.
	          
	          Laser + Circle-	Both the circle dot and the laser beam.
	          
	          Crosshair + Circle-	Both the crosshair and the laser beam.
	          
	  Sight to Surface:
	  
	    If using one of the reticles instead of the Laser Sight, enabling this will align
	    the reticle to the surface it hits.
	
	  Laser Sight Source:
	    
	    Choose whether the laser sight comes out of the barrel, or an emitter elsewhere
	    on the weapon. Just like with a real laser sight, you will have to manually compensate
	    your aim based on the location of the emitter.
	    
	      Options:
	        
			Laser Emitter-	The laser sight comes from a different part of the gun,
					but is parallel to where the bullets will go. You must
					take note of where the baarrel is actually aiming
					relative to the laser for perfect shots.
	 
	        	Barrel-		The laser comes out of the gun's barrel and shows exactly
	                		where the bullets will go. This makes aiming easier, but
	                		is less realistic.
	    
	  Haptic Feedback:
	  
	    Enable or disable haptic feedback on the game controller.
	    
	  GUI mode:
	  
	    Select how in game GUIS will be interacted with.
	    
	      Options:
	      
	          Touch Activated-	When the player gets close to a GUI and looks at it,
	                    		the weapon will lower and the weapon hand will change
	                    		to a pointer finger.  The GUI can be used as a virtual 
	                   		touchscreen.
	                    
	          Aim Activated-	When the player approaches a GUI and aims the weapon at
		  			it, the weapon will lower, but aiming the weapon will
					control the cursor on the GUI screen.  Fire will click
					the screen.  If the current weapon doesn't have a muzzle
					( grenade, fists, chainsaw, soul cube, artifact), the
					player gaze will control the cursor.
	                    
	          Look Activated-	When the player approaches a GUI and looks at it, the
		  			weapon will lower and the player look direction will
					be used to control the cursor.
	                    
	                    
	Menu: Rendering Options:
	
	  Options that affect VR graphics.

	  Pixel Density -	A multiplier used to increase the resolution of the rendered
	  			image. Increasing this setting will dramatically impact
				performance. Note that this setting will be used ON TOP OF any
				setting in your HMD drivers.  If you are using some form of
				supersampling by default in your HMD software, you may want
				to set this to 1.
	          
	  MSAA Level-		Disable MSAA, or set the desired level of sampling.
	  
	  Chaperone:
	      
	      This setting has moved here from the VR Options > Comfort + Safety Protocols.
		  
	      This setting is more about safety than motion sickness. It lets you turn the
	      Chaperone or Guardian grid on all the time, or only when you're throwing
	      grenades, or when you're swinging around virtual Melee weapons. The grid
	      can't be disabled completely, but it can be set to "Near" for normal chaperone
	      behaviour. I broke my TV throwing things in Budget Cuts, so I recommend forcing
	      the chaperone on when throwing, at least. The options from most reckless to
	      safest are: "Near", "Throw", "Melee", or "Always". The default is "Melee",
	      which means the grid will be on whenever you're using grenades, the grabber,
	      the chainsaw, or fists.
	      
	        Options:
		
			Melee-		The Chaperone or Guardian grid will be on when using
					melee weapons. ( Grenades, grabber, chainsaw, or fists.)
	                      	
	              	Always-		The Chaperone or Guardian grid will always be on.
	              
	             	Near-		Normal Chaperone or Guardian behavior, the grid will
	                      		appear when you or your controllers are too close to
	                      		the virtual boundary.
	                      	
	              	Throwing-	On when throwing grenades.

	  Asynchronous SpaceWarp:
	
	    Oculus only! Adjust how the game handles low framerates.
	      
	        Options:
	              
		      Default-		Don't mess with the Oculus default.
	              
		      Disabled-		use Asynchronous TimeWarp (works at any FPS)
		      			instead of Asynchronous SpaceWarp (recommended).
	              
		      Enabled-		use Asynchronous SpaceWarp at 45 FPS whenever
		      			FPS drops below 90 FPS.
	              
		      45 FPS ATW-	Always use Asynchronous TimeWarp, locked to 45 FPS
	              
		      45 FPS ASW-	Always use Asynchronous SpaceWarp, locked to 45 FPS
	              
	  
	  3D Guis-	The in game GUIS can look flat - enabling this setting adds some
	          	depth.  May be disabled if effect is disagreeable.
	          
	          
	              
	Menu: VR Profile Options:

	  Active Profile:
	  
	    This works now. Select profile.
	    
	      Options:
	      
	          Official Profile-	Use the IPD and height provided by the HMD runtime.
	                    
	          Manual Profile-	Use the IPD and Height defined in the Manual Profile
		  			entries.
	          
	  Oculus Profile IPD:	The IPD reported by the HMD runtime. 
	  
	  Manual Profile IPD:	This IPD will be used if Active Profile is set to Manual.

9) CONSOLE VARIABLES AND COMMANDS
__________________________________________

Access the console with the ~` key, or you can add these to your config file in:
%UserProfile%\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM 3 BFG\Fully Possessed\vr_oculus.cfg
(or vr_openvr.cfg)

Commands:

	restartMap - 	Restart the map, preserving your inventory. Use this if you get stuck,
			or you load a game from another mod and you were near the start, to get
			rid of the glitches. Or use this if the glitches make it impossible to
	             	continue.

	endLevel-	Win this map and continue to the next level, with all your inventory
			and the level's important items. Use this if you get stuck near the
			end of a map, due to glitches. I consider this to be sort of cheating.

	noclip-		Toggle no-clipping mode, in case you accidentally teleport somewhere
			you can't get out of

	listDevices-	lists all detected audio playback devices.
			( use cvar s_device to select and audio device from this list )

	9 = Slow Mo, Chaperone, Reduce FOV, 10 = Third Person, 11 = Particles,
	12 = Particles & Chaperone 0, 12
	
vr_strobeTime 500 INTEGER - Time in ms between flashes when blacking screen. 0 = no strobe

vr_instantAccel 1 BOOL - optional instant player acceleration/decelaration when using artifical
			movement (to reduce motion sickness)

timescale 1.0 FLOAT - game speed multiplier. Used by slow mo motion sickness fix. If 
			there's an issue with it, you may need to set timescale 1
			
vr_chaperone 2 INTEGER - Chaperone/Guardian mode. 0 = when near, 1 = when throwing,
			2 = when melee, 3 = when dodging, 4 = always 0, 4 
			
vr_handSwapsAnalogs 0 BOOL - Should swapping the weapon hand affect analog controls 
				(stick or touchpad) or just buttons/triggers?
				0 = only swap buttons, 1 = swap all controls
				
vr_autoSwitchControllers 1 BOOL - Automatically switch to/from gamepad mode when using
			gamepad/motion controller. Should be true unless you're trying
			to use both together, or you get false detections. 0 = no, 1 = yes.

vr_headshotMultiplier 2.5 FLOAT - Add headshot damage multiplier for projectile weapons
			with no splash damage (and fists). Damage inflicted by the fists, pistol,
			shotgun, machinegun, chaingun, and plasmagun will be multiplied by this factor
			when enemy is hit in the head. Multiplier only affects enemies who already had
			a defined head damage zone with > 1 damage scale, so it does not affect most boss
			monsters (cyberdemon, guardian, seekers, maledict and saboath). Also does not
			affect the pinky, trite, tick, cacodemon and lost soul enemies. 1.0f thru 5.0f.
			Setting cvar to 1.0 adds no additional damage.

vr_shotgunChoke 0 FLOAT - This enables an optional 'choke' for the shotgun, by reducing the spread.
			The shotgun is supposed to be a closeup weapon in the game, but the depth provided
			in VR really changes how it feels. IMO, it seems underpowered unless you are on top of
			an enemy, due to the extreme pellet spread.
			% To choke shotgun. 0 = None, 100 = Full Choke

vr_useHandPoses 0 BOOL - If using oculus touch, enable finger poses when hands are empty or in guis

vr_cinematics 0 INTEGER - Cinematic type. 0 = Immersive, 1 = Cropped, 2 = Projected

r_useShadowMapping 0 - Use soft shadow mapping instead of hard stencil shadows

___________________________________________________

10) KNOWN ISSUES
__________________________________________

See https://github.com/KozGit/DOOM-3-BFG-VR/issues

Doom 3 wasn't designed to work with shadow maps so:

- Some lights cause shadow acne with shadow mapping
- Some shadows might almost disappear due to the shadow filtering

   download and extract it somewhere. Copy the LibOVR folder to DOOM-3-BFG-VR/neo/libs

6. (UPDATED) Init/Update the submodules in Git to get OpenVR. In TortoiseGit, right click in the
   folder then choose TortoiseGit > Submodule Update... then press OK.

7. Open the following file in Visual Studio and compile it:
	DOOM-3-BFG-VR/build/Doom3BFGVR.sln
	
8. (UPDATED) Download ffmpeg-4.0-win32-shared.zip from
	https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/shared/
	and/or ffmpeg-4.0-win64-shared.zip from
	https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/shared/

9. Extract the FFmpeg DLLs to your current build directory (eg. Release) under DOOM-3-BFG-VR/build/

10. (NEW) Download SIGIL from https://www.romerogames.ie/si6il and extract SIGIL.WAD to Doom3-BFG-VR\vr_assets\wads

11. Copy the Fully Possessed folder from Doom3-BFG-VR\vr_assets\ to your DOOM 3 BFG Edition folder.

12. (OPTIONAL) If Doom 3 BFG wasn't installed from Steam or GOG, set the path in Visual Studio.
    Right click project Doom3BFGVR, click Properties. Set Configuration to All Configurations.
    Choose Debugging, set Command Arguments to:
    +set fs_basepath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DOOM 3 BFG Edition"

13) COMPILING ON LINUX
_________________________

LINUX VR:

build the engine:

    cd neo
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug has really bad VR performance
    make -j$(nproc)

symlink binary + mod files to wine steam installation and run

    cd steam/SteamApps/common/DOOM\ 3\ BFG\ Edition
    ln -s ~/DOOM-3-BFG-VR/neo/build/Doom3BFGVR .
    ln -s ~/DOOM-3-BFG-VR/vr_assets/Fully\ Possessed/ .
    export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5COMPAT MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=450 #mesa needs to fake a compat profile
    ./Doom3BFGVR

Use enter (have to look at the menu?) and the keyboard to get past the menu and start a game

KNOWN LINUX ISSUES:

Controller buttons don't work


*** The following instructions were for an older version of Doom 3 BFG and probably no longer apply.

1. You need the following dependencies in order to compile Doom3BFGVR with all features:
 
	On Debian or Ubuntu:

		> apt-get install cmake libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev
		libavutil-dev libswscale-dev
	
	On Fedora

		// TODO add ffmpeg libs for bink videos
		
		> yum install cmake SDL-devel openal-devel
	
	On openSUSE (tested in 13.1)
	
		> zypper in openal-soft-devel cmake libSDL-devel libffmpeg1-devel
	
		For SDL 2 replace "libSDL-devel" with "libSDL2-devel".
		"libffmpeg1-devel" requires the PackMan repository. If you don't have that repo,
		and don't want to add it, remove the "libffmpeg1-devel" option and compile without
		ffmpeg support. If you have the repo and compiles with ffmpeg support, make sure
		you download "libffmpeg1-devel", and not "libffmpeg-devel".
	
	Instead of SDL2 development files you can also use SDL1.2. Install SDL 1.2 and add to the
	cmake parameters -DSDL2=OFF
	
	SDL2 has better input support (especially in the console) and better 
	support for multiple displays (especially in fullscreen mode).


2. Generate the Makefiles using CMake:

	> cd neo/
	> ./cmake-eclipse-linux-profile.sh
	
3. Compile DOOM-3-BFG targets with

	> cd ../build
	> make

14) BUG REPORTS
__________________________________________

DOOM-3-BFG VR: Fully Possessed is not perfect, it is not bug free just like all other software.
To fixing as many problems as possible, we need as many bug reports as possible.
We cannot fix anything if we don't know it's broken :).

The best way to tell us about a bug is by submitting a bug report at our GitHub bug tracker page:

	https://github.com/KozGit/DOOM-3-BFG-VR/issues

The most important fact about this tracker is that we cannot simply forget to fix the bugs which
are posted there. It is also a great way to keep track of fixed issues.

If you want to report an issue with the game, you should make sure that your report includes all
information useful to characterize and reproduce the bug.

    * What version you are using, and what mods you have installed.
    * What hardware are you using ( Vive, Rift, Touch, Gamepad etc. )
    * Search on Google
    * Include the computer's hardware and software description ( CPU, RAM, 3D Card, distribution,
    	kernel etc. )
    * If appropriate, send a console log, a screenshot, an strace ..
    * If you are sending a console log, make sure to enable developer output:

              Doom3BFGVR.exe +set developer 1 +set logfile 2

NOTE: We cannot help you with OS-specific issues like configuring OpenGL correctly, configuring
ALSA or configuring the network.
